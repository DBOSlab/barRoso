\title{Generate Herbarium Labels from Field Book Records}
\usage{
barroso_labels(fieldbook = NULL,
               dir_create = "results_herbarium_labels",
               file_label = "herbarium_labels.pdf")

\arguments{
\item{fieldbook}{A data frame or CSV file path containing herbarium collection
records. Columns must include taxonomic, locality, and collector fields. See
the README for details on expected field names and formatting.}

\item{dir_create}{Output directory for label files. A subfolder named with the
current date will be created inside this directory. Default: \code{"results_herbarium_labels"}.}

\item{file_label}{Base name for the generated label PDFs. When multiple pages
are required, numbered suffixes will be added automatically. Default: \code{"herbarium_labels.pdf"}.}

\description{
Creates printable herbarium labels from field book data stored in a CSV-formatted file.
This function is optimized for records from the USA by generating geographic maps
at the county level. For records from other countries, only the country-level map
is included. If geographic coordinates are available, specimen points are plotted
on the maps. The function also retrieves taxon authorities and performs automatic
nomenclatural updates using the \href{https://idiv-biodiversity.github.io/lcvplants/}{\code{lcvplants}}
package.
}
\details{
The function performs extensive pre-processing including trimming extra spaces,
fixing punctuation, removing artifacts, and inserting default values for missing
taxon/specimen info. Scientific names are cross-referenced against the
\code{lcvplants} database to update taxonomy and retrieve the correct author citation.
Locality and habitat descriptions are automatically formatted for line breaks.
Labels are arranged in grids of six per page and exported as paginated PDF files.
