\title{Standardize Collector Names in Biodiversity Records}
\usage{
std_recordedBy(df = NULL,
               colname_recordedBy = "recordedBy",
               colname_recordNumber = "recordNumber",
               rm_original_column = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing biodiversity records.}

\item{colname_recordedBy}{Column name for the main collector (default: "recordedBy").}

\item{colname_recordNumber}{Column name for the collector number (default: "recordNumber").}

\item{rm_original_column}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, original columns are removed after
cleaning. If \code{FALSE}, they are retained with \verb{*Original} suffixes (default: \code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
A data frame with cleaned and harmonized collector name fields. A new column
\code{addCollector} is added where additional collectors are identified.
}
\description{
Cleans and standardizes the \code{recordedBy} and \code{recordNumber} fields in biodiversity
collection data, consolidating collector names and removing inconsistencies across
herbarium records. The function identifies and formats collector initials, extracts
main collector names, and handles multilingual and complex name structures including
multiple collectors, Asian unicode names, and Brazilian surname conventions.
}
\details{
This function supports reconciliation of biodiversity records, especially for resolving
collector name discrepancies across duplicate specimens. A new column \code{addCollector}
is created when multiple collectors are detected, storing secondary collectors
as \code{"et al."}. Original columns can be preserved or overwritten.

Specifically, this function performs extensive string cleaning including:
\itemize{
\item Converting unicode (e.g., Chinese) to Latin names
\item Parsing and normalizing collector names split by \code{&}, \code{and}, \code{e}, \code{y}, \verb{;}, \code{|}, etc.
\item Handling cases of one, two, or more collectors
\item Cleaning spacing, punctuation, and known collector aliases
\item Adding standardized initials or removing redundant suffixes (e.g., "et al.")
}
}
